# KNMI

The official weather of the **Netherlands** in Gladys: the observations, forecasts and **warnings of
the KNMI** (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut), read through the free
[Weerlive.nl](https://weerlive.nl) API. Made for the Dutch living in France, for people near the
Belgian–Dutch border, and for anyone with a house in the Netherlands.

> **Developed without a Weerlive account: feedback welcome.** The integration is built and tested
> against real Weerlive answers (published by the python-weerlive and ha-knmi projects), not
> against the live service. Please report what works and what does not in the
> [issues](https://github.com/guim31/gladys-knmi/issues).

This integration is not affiliated with KNMI nor with Weerlive.

## Presentation

- **One device per place**: a Gladys house (its location), Dutch towns or coordinates, five places
  at most.
- Each device shows the temperature, the feels-like temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind
  (Beaufort, km/h and direction), visibility, the precipitation forecast for the coming hour, the
  conditions, sunrise and sunset, and the **KNMI warning**: its colour (green, yellow, orange, red),
  its title and text, and the next warning announced.
- A **scene trigger** _New KNMI warning_, with the KNMI text ready for a notification.
- A **dashboard widget** _KNMI forecast_: live values, warnings, sun and the 5-day forecast.
- Read-only: nothing can be controlled.

## Prerequisites

- Gladys Assistant **5.2.0** or later (house picker in the configuration, widgets, scene
  triggers).
- A **free Weerlive API key**: fill in the form on
  [weerlive.nl/delen.php](https://weerlive.nl/delen.php) with your email address; the key arrives
  by email. Weerlive reserves the free key for personal and hobby use.
- Internet access for Gladys (the integration calls `weerlive.nl`).
- The install screen asks for access to the **location of your houses**: it is only used for the
  house you pick in the configuration.

## Configuration

Open **Integrations → KNMI → Configuration**.

### Weerlive API key

Paste the key received by email. It is stored in the Gladys configuration, never in the logs.

### Places

- **Gladys house**: follow the weather at the location of this house (set in Settings → Houses).
  The coordinates are sent to Weerlive rounded to two decimals, about 1 km.
- **Other places**: Dutch towns (`Amsterdam`, `'s-Hertogenbosch`) or coordinates
  (`52.09,5.12`), separated by semicolons. Weerlive picks the nearest station: the _Test the
  connection_ button tells you which place it found.
- Five places at most, house included.

Then open the **Discovery** tab and add the devices you want: only the added devices are read.

### Refresh and quota

The free key allows **300 requests a day**, and Weerlive refreshes its data every 10 minutes. The
integration reads each added place every 10 minutes at most (the _Refresh interval_ field), and
slows down by itself with several places so that all of them stay under 240 requests a day: 12
minutes with two places, 18 with three, 30 with five. The last reading is kept in `/data`, so a
restart of Gladys does not spend the quota again, and showing the widget never makes a request.

### Language

_Language of the texts_ (French by default) names the features of new devices and writes the
conditions and dates. Feature names are fixed when a device is added. The KNMI warning texts stay
in Dutch, as the KNMI writes them.

## Devices

Every feature is read-only.

| Feature                    | Value                                                      |

| Visibility                 | km                                                         |
| Precipitation, coming hour | mm forecast for the hour in progress                       |
| Conditions                 | sunny, cloudy, showers… in the chosen language             |

| Weather alarm              | 1 when Weerlive flags a weather alarm for the region       |
| Next KNMI warning level    | colour of the next warning announced (0 when none)         |
| Next KNMI warning from     | its start, or "None"                                       |

## Widget

Add the **KNMI forecast** widget to a dashboard and pick a place. It shows the place and the
current conditions, three live tiles (temperature, feels like, wind), the 5-day forecast (minimum
and maximum, chance of rain, wind), the warning in force and the next one with their colours,
sunrise and sunset, and the Dutch KNMI text when a warning is in force. It is built from the last
reading: it costs no request.

## Scene trigger

**New KNMI warning** fires once per new warning:

- _In force now_: a yellow, orange or red warning starts for the place, or another warning
  replaces it;
- _Announced for later_: the KNMI announces a warning starting later, the first time this colour
  and start are seen.

Filters: the place, the colours, when. Variables for the actions: `place`, `level` (`yellow`,
`orange`, `red`), `level_number` (1 to 3), `phase` (`current`, `upcoming`), `title` and `text` (in
Dutch, for a warning in force), `starts_at` (ISO date). The first reading after the installation
only records what is in force, and a restart never fires the same warning twice. The end of a
warning is not an event: use the _KNMI warning level_ feature (`= 0`).

## Configuration action

**Test the connection** reads the first place once (one request of the quota) and tells you
whether the key is accepted, which place Weerlive found, how many requests are left today and the
pace of the readings.

## Scene examples

- **Storm warning**: trigger _New KNMI warning_, colours orange and red, _In force now_ → send a
  message "KNMI {{triggerEvent.data.level}} warning: {{triggerEvent.data.title}}".
- **Close the awnings**: trigger _Device state_ on _Wind (Beaufort)_ of your house, ≥ 6 → close the
  awnings or the shutters.
- **The night before**: trigger _New KNMI warning_, _Announced for later_ → a notification with
  `starts_at`, to bring the garden furniture in.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Weerlive refused the API key"**: check the key received by email, without spaces.
- **"Daily Weerlive limit reached"**: the readings resume after midnight, Dutch time. Fewer places
  or a longer interval help; the _Test_ button also spends one request.
- **"Weerlive does not answer"**: an outage of the service or of the Internet access of Gladys.
  The readings resume by themselves.
- **No value on a device**: check that the device was added in the Discovery tab.
- **Odd place**: Weerlive takes the nearest station; type another town or coordinates.
- More details: set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` on the container and read its logs.

## Limits

- The data covers the Netherlands: a place far from it gets the nearest Dutch station, or nothing.
- The warning texts are in Dutch, as the KNMI publishes them.
- At most five places per key, and a reading every 10 minutes at best.
- Weerlive says its free key is for personal and hobby use.
- Developed without a Weerlive account, tested on real published answers.
